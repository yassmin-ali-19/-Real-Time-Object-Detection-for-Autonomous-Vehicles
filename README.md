# -Real-Time-Object-Detection-for-Autonomous-Vehicles
Welcome! This project is all about creating a real-time object detection system for autonomous vehicles—a system that allows cars to truly “see” and understand their surroundings. Autonomous vehicles rely heavily on accurate perception to navigate safely, and being able to detect objects like pedestrians, vehicles, traffic signs, and road obstacles in real time is absolutely critical.
The goal of this project is to equip self-driving cars with a robust and intelligent vision system that can:

Identify pedestrians to prevent accidents and protect lives.

Recognize vehicles around the car for safe lane changes, overtaking, and maintaining distance.

Detect traffic signs and signals to follow traffic rules automatically.

Spot obstacles and road hazards to react quickly in unpredictable situations.

By combining advanced machine learning models, transfer learning, and real-world driving datasets, this system is designed to work reliably.Ultimately, the project aims to enhance the safety, efficiency, and intelligence of autonomous vehicles, making them smarter, more aware, and better prepared for the challenges of real-world driving.
